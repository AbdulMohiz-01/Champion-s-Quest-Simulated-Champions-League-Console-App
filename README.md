# Champions League Simulator

This console application allows you to simulate the UEFA Champions League, starting from the group stage. The program randomly distributes 32 teams into 8 groups, following specific rules. It then calculates match results by randomly determining the number of goals for each team (Random(4)). The application displays the results of all matches, including the group stage.

Please note that the semi-final and final stages are not yet implemented. Contributions are welcome to help complete these sections.

## Rules and Functionality

- **Group Stage Draw:** The 32 teams are distributed into 8 groups based on the rules specified in the UEFA Champions League regulations.

- **Group Stage Matches:** The program randomly calculates match results, including the number of goals scored by each team (0-3 goals). The results of all group stage matches are displayed.

- **Group Stage Tables:** The application calculates the points and goals for each team in each group, determining the winner and runner-up. The group stage tables are displayed, showing the position, team, points, and goals.

- **Next Rounds Draw:** The top two teams from each group are used to draw the matches for the next rounds. The draw follows the UEFA regulations.

- **Match Results:** The program randomly calculates match results for the knockout stages, including the number of goals scored (0-3 goals). In case of a tie, an additional random goal is added to determine the winner. This rule also applies to the final match.
